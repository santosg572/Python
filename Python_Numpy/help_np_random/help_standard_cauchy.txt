======================= standard_cauchy ===============================
Help on built-in function standard_cauchy:

standard_cauchy(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
    standard_cauchy(size=None)
    
    Draw samples from a standard Cauchy distribution with mode = 0.
    
    Also known as the Lorentz distribution.
    
    .. note::
        New code should use the ``standard_cauchy`` method of a ``default_rng()``
        instance instead; please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
        ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
        single value is returned.
    
    Returns
    -------
    samples : ndarray or scalar
        The drawn samples.
    
    See Also
    --------
    random.Generator.standard_cauchy: which should be used for new code.
    
    Notes
    -----
    The probability density function for the full Cauchy distribution is
    
    .. math:: P(x; x_0, \gamma) = \frac{1}{\pi \gamma \bigl[ 1+
              (\frac{x-x_0}{\gamma})^2 \bigr] }
    
    and the Standard Cauchy distribution just sets :math:`x_0=0` and
    :math:`\gamma=1`
    
    The Cauchy distribution arises in the solution to the driven harmonic
    oscillator problem, and also describes spectral line broadening. It
    also describes the distribution of values at which a line tilted at
    a random angle will cut the x axis.
    
    When studying hypothesis tests that assume normality, seeing how the
    tests perform on data from a Cauchy distribution is a good indicator of
    their sensitivity to a heavy-tailed distribution, since the Cauchy looks
    very much like a Gaussian distribution, but with heavier tails.

    Examples
    --------
    Draw samples and plot the distribution:
    
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> s = np.random.standard_cauchy(1000000)
    >>> s = s[(s>-25) & (s<25)]  # truncate distribution so it plots well
    >>> plt.hist(s, bins=100)
    >>> plt.show()
