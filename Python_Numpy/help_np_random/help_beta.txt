Help on built-in function beta:

beta(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
    beta(a, b, size=None)
    
    Draw samples from a Beta distribution.
    
    The Beta distribution is a special case of the Dirichlet distribution,
    and is related to the Gamma distribution.  It has the probability
    distribution function
    
    .. math:: f(x; a,b) = \frac{1}{B(\alpha, \beta)} x^{\alpha - 1}
                                                     (1 - x)^{\beta - 1},
    
    where the normalization, B, is the beta function,
    
    .. math:: B(\alpha, \beta) = \int_0^1 t^{\alpha - 1}
                                 (1 - t)^{\beta - 1} dt.
    
    It is often seen in Bayesian inference and order statistics.
    
    .. note::
        New code should use the ``beta`` method of a ``default_rng()``
        instance instead; please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    a : float or array_like of floats
        Alpha, positive (>0).
    b : float or array_like of floats
        Beta, positive (>0).
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
        ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
        a single value is returned if ``a`` and ``b`` are both scalars.
        Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(a, b).size`` samples are drawn.
    
    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or scalar
        Drawn samples from the parameterized beta distribution.
    
    See Also
    --------
    random.Generator.beta: which should be used for new code.
