======================= get_state ===============================
Help on built-in function get_state:

get_state(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
    get_state()
    
    Return a tuple representing the internal state of the generator.
    
    For more details, see `set_state`.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    legacy : bool, optional
        Flag indicating to return a legacy tuple state when the BitGenerator
        is MT19937, instead of a dict.
    
    Returns
    -------
    out : {tuple(str, ndarray of 624 uints, int, int, float), dict}
        The returned tuple has the following items:
    
        1. the string 'MT19937'.
        2. a 1-D array of 624 unsigned integer keys.
        3. an integer ``pos``.
        4. an integer ``has_gauss``.
        5. a float ``cached_gaussian``.
    
        If `legacy` is False, or the BitGenerator is not MT19937, then
        state is returned as a dictionary.

    Notes
    -----
    `set_state` and `get_state` are not needed to work with any of the
    random distributions in NumPy. If the internal state is manually altered,
    the user should know exactly what he/she is doing.
