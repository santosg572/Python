Help on built-in function wald:

wald(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
    wald(mean, scale, size=None)
    
    Draw samples from a Wald, or inverse Gaussian, distribution.
    
    As the scale approaches infinity, the distribution becomes more like a
    Gaussian. Some references claim that the Wald is an inverse Gaussian
    with mean equal to 1, but this is by no means universal.
    
    The inverse Gaussian distribution was first studied in relationship to
    Brownian motion. In 1956 M.C.K. Tweedie used the name inverse Gaussian
    because there is an inverse relationship between the time to cover a
    unit distance and distance covered in unit time.
    
    .. note::
        New code should use the ``wald`` method of a ``default_rng()``
        instance instead; please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    mean : float or array_like of floats
        Distribution mean, must be > 0.
    scale : float or array_like of floats
        Scale parameter, must be > 0.
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
        ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
        a single value is returned if ``mean`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
        Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(mean, scale).size`` samples are drawn.
    
    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or scalar
        Drawn samples from the parameterized Wald distribution.
    
    See Also
    --------
    random.Generator.wald: which should be used for new code.
    
    Notes
    -----
    The probability density function for the Wald distribution is
    
    .. math:: P(x;mean,scale) = \sqrt{\frac{scale}{2\pi x^3}}e^
                                \frac{-scale(x-mean)^2}{2\cdotp mean^2x}
    
    As noted above the inverse Gaussian distribution first arise
    from attempts to model Brownian motion. It is also a
    competitor to the Weibull for use in reliability modeling and
    modeling stock returns and interest rate processes.

    Examples
    --------
    Draw values from the distribution and plot the histogram:
    
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> h = plt.hist(np.random.wald(3, 2, 100000), bins=200, density=True)
    >>> plt.show()

None
