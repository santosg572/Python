Quick start

Welcome to pygame! Once you've got pygame installed (pip install pygame or pip3 install pygame for most people), the next question is how to get a game loop running. Pygame, unlike some other libraries, gives you full control of program execution. That freedom means it is easy to mess up in your initial steps.

Here is a good example of a basic setup (opens the window, updates the screen, and handles events)--

# Example file showing a basic pygame "game loop"
import pygame

# pygame setup
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1280, 720))
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
running = True

while running:
    # poll for events
    # pygame.QUIT event means the user clicked X to close your window
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # fill the screen with a color to wipe away anything from last frame
    screen.fill("purple")

    # RENDER YOUR GAME HERE

    # flip() the display to put your work on screen
    pygame.display.flip()

    clock.tick(60)  # limits FPS to 60

pygame.quit()

Here is a slightly more fleshed out example, which shows you how to move something (a circle in this case) around on screen--

# Example file showing a circle moving on screen
import pygame

# pygame setup
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1280, 720))
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
running = True
dt = 0

player_pos = pygame.Vector2(screen.get_width() / 2, screen.get_height() / 2)

while running:
    # poll for events
    # pygame.QUIT event means the user clicked X to close your window
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # fill the screen with a color to wipe away anything from last frame
    screen.fill("purple")

    pygame.draw.circle(screen, "red", player_pos, 40)

    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    if keys[pygame.K_w]:
        player_pos.y -= 300 * dt
    if keys[pygame.K_s]:
        player_pos.y += 300 * dt
    if keys[pygame.K_a]:
        player_pos.x -= 300 * dt
    if keys[pygame.K_d]:
        player_pos.x += 300 * dt

    # flip() the display to put your work on screen
    pygame.display.flip()

    # limits FPS to 60
    # dt is delta time in seconds since last frame, used for framerate-
    # independent physics.
    dt = clock.tick(60) / 1000

pygame.quit()

Introduction to Pygame

    An introduction to the basics of pygame. This is written for users of Python and appeared in volume two of the Py magazine.
Import and Initialize

    The beginning steps on importing and initializing pygame. The pygame package is made of several modules. Some modules are not included on all platforms.
How do I move an Image?

    A basic tutorial that covers the concepts behind 2D computer animation. Information about drawing and clearing objects to make them appear animated.
Chimp Tutorial, Line by Line

    The pygame examples include a simple program with an interactive fist and a chimpanzee. This was inspired by the annoying flash banner of the early 2000s. This tutorial examines every line of code used in the example.
Sprite Module Introduction

    Pygame includes a higher level sprite module to help organize games. The sprite module includes several classes that help manage details found in almost all games types. The Sprite classes are a bit more advanced than the regular pygame modules, and need more understanding to be properly used.
Surfarray Introduction

    Pygame used the NumPy python module to allow efficient per pixel effects on images. Using the surface arrays is an advanced feature that allows custom effects and filters. This also examines some of the simple effects from the pygame example, arraydemo.py.
Camera Module Introduction

    Pygame, as of 1.9, has a camera module that allows you to capture images, watch live streams, and do some basic computer vision. This tutorial covers those use cases.
