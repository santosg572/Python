<p>In this second edition, the outline of chapters and sections has been preserved. The subtitle “An Introduction”, as suggested by several reviewers, has been deleted. The content, however, is brought up to date, both in the text and in the notes. Many passages in the text have been either corrected or improved. Some biographical notes have been added as well as a few exercises and computer assignments. The typographical appearance has also been improved by printing vectors and matrices consistently in boldface types.</p>
<p>With regard to computer language in illustrations and exercises, we now adopt uniformly Matlab. For readers not familiar with Matlab, there are a number of introductory texts available, some, like Moler [2004], Otto and Denier [2005], Stanoyevitch [2005] that combine Matlab with numerical computing, others, like Knight [2000], Higham and Higham [2005], Hunt, Lipsman and Rosenberg [2006], and Driscoll [2009], more exclusively focused on Matlab.</p>
<p>The major novelty, however, is a complete set of detailed solutions to all exercises and machine assignments. The solution manual is available to instructors upon request at the publisher’s website <a class="reference external" href="http://www.birkhauser-science.com/978-0-8176">http://www.birkhauser-science.com/978-0-8176</a>- 8258-3. Selected solutions are also included in the text to give students an idea of what is expected. The bibliography has been expanded to reflect technical advances in the field and to include references to new books and expository accounts. As a result, the text has undergone an expansion in size of about 20%.</p>

<h2>Prologue<a class="headerlink" href="#prologue" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>P1 Overview</strong></p>
<p>Numerical Analysis is the branch of mathematics that provides tools and methods
for solving mathematical problems in numerical form. The objective is to develop
detailed computational procedures, capable of being implemented on electronic
computers, and to study their performance characteristics. Related fields are Sci-
entific Computation, which explores the application of numerical techniques and
computer architectures to concrete problems arising in the sciences and engineering;
Complexity Theory, which analyzes the number of “operations” and the amount of
computer memory required to solve a problem; and Parallel Computation, which
is concerned with organizing computational procedures in a manner that allows
running various parts of the procedures simultaneously on different processors.</p>
<p>The problems dealt with in computational mathematics come from virtually
all branches of pure and applied mathematics. There are computational aspects
in number theory, combinatorics, abstract algebra, linear algebra, approximation
theory, geometry, statistics, optimization, complex analysis, nonlinear equations,
differential and other functional equations, and so on. It is clearly impossible
to deal with all these topics in a single text of reasonable size. Indeed, the
tendency today is to develop specialized texts dealing with one or the other
of these topics. In the present text we concentrate on subject matters that are
basic to problems in approximation theory, nonlinear equations, and differential
equations. Accordingly, we have chapters on machine arithmetic, approximation
and interpolation, numerical differentiation and integration, nonlinear equations,
one-step and multistep methods for ordinary differential equations, and boundary
value problems in ordinary differential equations. Important topics not covered
in this text are computational number theory, algebra, and geometry; constructive
methods in optimization and complex analysis; numerical linear algebra; and the
numerical solution of problems involving partial differential equations and integral
equations. Selected texts for these areas are enumerated in Sect. P3.</p>
<p>We now describe briefly the topics treated in this text. Chapter 1 deals with
the basic facts of life regarding machine computation. It recognizes that, although
present-day computers are extremely powerful in terms of computational speed,
reliability, and amount of memory available, they are less than ideal – unless
supplemented by appropriate software – when it comes to the precision available,
and accuracy attainable, in the execution of elementary arithmetic operations. This
raises serious questions as to how arithmetic errors, either present in the input
data of a problem or committed during the execution of a solution algorithm,
affect the accuracy of the desired results. Concepts and tools required to answer
such questions are put forward in this introductory chapter. In Chap. 2, the central
theme is the approximation of functions by simpler functions, typically polynomials
and piecewise polynomial functions. Approximation in the sense of least squares
provides an opportunity to introduce orthogonal polynomials, which are relevant
also in connection with problems of numerical integration treated in Chap. 3. A large
part of the chapter, however, deals with polynomial interpolation and associated
error estimates, which are basic to many numerical procedures for integrating
functions and differential equations. Also discussed briefly is inverse interpolation,
an idea useful in solving equations.</p>
<p>First applications of interpolation theory are given in Chap. 3, where the tasks
presented are the computation of derivatives and definite integrals. Although the
formulae developed for derivatives are subject to the detrimental effects of machine
arithmetic, they are useful, nevertheless, for purposes of discretizing differential
operators. The treatment of numerical integration includes routine procedures, such
as the trapezoidal and Simpson’s rules, appropriate for well-behaved integrands, as
well as the more sophisticated procedures based on Gaussian quadrature to deal
with singularities. It is here where orthogonal polynomials reappear. The method of
undetermined coefficients is another technique for developing integration formulae.
It is applied to approximate general linear functionals, the Peano representation
of linear functionals providing an important tool for estimating the error. The
chapter ends with a discussion of extrapolation techniques; although applicable to
more general problems, they are inserted here since the composite trapezoidal rule
together with the Euler–Maclaurin formula provides the best-known application –
Romberg integration.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 deals with iterative methods for solving nonlinear equations and
systems thereof, the pi`ece de r´esistance being Newton’s method. The emphasis here
lies in the study of, and the tools necessary to analyze, convergence. The special
case of algebraic equations is also briefly given attention.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 is the first of three chapters devoted to the numerical solution of
ordinary differential equations. It concerns itself with one-step methods for solving
initial value problems, such as the Runge–Kutta method, and gives a detailed
analysis of local and global errors. Also included is a brief introduction to stiff
equations and special methods to deal with them. Multistep methods and, in
particular, Dahlquist’s theory of stability and its applications, is the subject of
Chap. 6. The final chapter (Chap. 7) is devoted to boundary value problems and their
solution by shooting methods, finite difference techniques, and variational methods.</p>
<p><strong>P2 Numerical Analysis Software</strong></p>
<p>There are many software packages available, both in the public domain and dis-
tributed commercially, that deal with numerical analysis algorithms. A widely used
source of numerical software is Netlib, accessible at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.netlib.org">http://www.netlib.org</a>.</p>
<p>Large collections of general-purpose numerical algorithms are contained in
sources such as Slatec (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.netlib.org/slatec">http://www.netlib.org/slatec</a>) and TOMS
(ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software). Specialized packages relevant
to the topics in the chapters ahead are identified in the “Notes” to each chapter.
Likewise, specific files needed to do some of the machine assignments in the
Exercises are identified as part of the exercise.</p>
<p>Among the commercial software packages we mention the Visual Numerics
(formerly IMSL) and NAG libraries. Interactive systems include HiQ, Macsyma,
Maple, Mathcad, Mathematica, and Matlab. Many of these packages, in addition
to numerical computation, have symbolic computation and graphics capabilities.
Further information is available in the Netlib file commercial. For more libraries,
and for interactive systems, also see Lozier and Olver [1994, Sect. 3].</p>
<p>In this text we consistently use Matlab as a vehicle for describing algorithms
and as the software tool for carrying out some of the exercises and all machine
assignments.</p>
<p><strong>P3 Textbooks and Monographs</strong></p>
<p>We provide here an annotated list (ordered alphabetically with respect to authors)
of other textbooks on numerical analysis, written at about the same, or higher, level
as the present one. Following this, we also mention books and monographs dealing
with topics in computational mathematics not covered in our (and many other) books
on numerical analysis. Additional books dealing with specialized subject areas, as
well as other literature, are referenced in the “Notes” to the individual chapters. We
generally restrict ourselves to books written in English and, with a few exceptions,
published within the last 25 years or so. Even so, we have had to be selective. (No
value judgment is to be implied by our selections or omissions.) A reader with access
to the AMS (American Mathematical Society) MathSci Net homepage will have no
difficulty in retrieving a more complete list of relevant items, including older texts.</p>
<p><strong>P3.1 Selected Textbooks on Numerical Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Atkinson [1989] A comprehensive in-depth treatment of standard topics short of
partial differential equations; includes an appendix describing some of the better-
known software packages.</p>
<p>Atkinson and Han [2009] An advanced text on theoretical (as opposed to com-
putational) aspects of numerical analysis, making extensive use of functional
analysis.</p>
<p>Bruce, Giblin, and Rippon [1990] A collection of interesting mathematical prob-
lems, ranging from number theory and computer-aided design to differential
equations, that require the use of computers for their solution.</p>
<p>Cheney and Kincaid [1994] Although an undergraduate text, it covers a broad
area, has many examples from science and engineering as well as computer
programs; there are many exercises, including machine assignments.</p>
<p>Conte and de Boor [1980] A widely used text for upper-division undergraduate
students; written for a broad audience, with algorithmic concerns in the fore-
ground; has Fortran subroutines for many algorithms discussed in the text.</p>
<p>Dahlquist and Bj¨orck [2003, 2008] The first (2003) text – a reprint of the 1974
classic – provides a comprehensive introduction to all major fields of numerical
analysis, striking a good balance between theoretical issues and more practical
ones. The second text expands substantially on the more elementary topics
treated in the first and represents the first volume of more to come.</p>
<p>Deuflhard and Hohmann [2003] An introductory text with emphasis on machine
computation and algorithms; includes discussions of three-term recurrence
relations and stochastic eigenvalue problems (not usually found in textbooks),
but no differential equations.</p>
<p>Fr¨oberg [1985] A thorough and exceptionally lucid exposition of all major topics
of numerical analysis exclusive of algorithms and computer programs.</p>
<p>H¨ammerlin and Hoffmann [1991] Similar to Stoer and Bulirsch [2002] in its
emphasis on mathematical theory; has more on approximation theory and
multivariate interpolation and integration, but nothing on differential equations.</p>
<p>Householder [2006] A reissue of one of the early mathematical texts on the
subject, with coverage limited to systems of linear and nonlinear equations and
topics in approximation.</p>
<p>Isaacson and Keller [1994] One of the older but still eminently readable texts,
stressing the mathematical analysis of numerical methods.</p>
<p>Kincaid and Cheney [1996] Related to Cheney and Kincaid [1994] but more
mathematically oriented and unusually rich in exercises and bibliographic items.
Kress [1998] A rather comprehensive text with a strong functional analysis
component.</p>
<p>Neumaier [2001] A text emphasizing robust computation, including interval
arithmetic.</p>
<p>Rutishauser [1990] An annotated translation from the German of an older text
based on posthumous notes by one of the pioneers of numerical analysis;
although the subject matter reflects the state of the art in the early 1970s, the
treatment is highly original and is supplemented by translator’s notes to each
chapter pointing to more recent developments.</p>
<p>Schwarz [1989] A mathematically oriented treatment of all major areas of numer-
ical analysis, including ordinary and partial differential equations.</p>
<p>Stoer and Bulirsch [2002] Fairly comprehensive in coverage; written in a style
appealing more to mathematicians than engineers and computer scientists; has
many exercises and bibliographic references; serves not only as a textbook but
also as a reference work.</p>
<p>Todd [1979, 1977] Rather unique books, emphasizing problem-solving in areas
often not covered in other books on numerical analysis.</p>
<p><strong>P3.2 Monographs and Books on Specialized Topics</strong></p>
<p>A collection of outstanding survey papers on specialized topics in numerical
analysis is being assembled by Ciarlet and Lions [1990–2003] in handbooks of
numerical analysis; nine volumes have appeared so far. Another source of surveys
on a variety of topics is Acta numerica, an annual series of books edited by Iserles
[1992–2010], of which 19 volumes have been published so far. For an authoritative
account of the history of numerical analysis from the 16th through the 19th century,
the reader is referred to the book by Goldstine [1977]. For more recent history, see
Bultheel and Cools, eds. [2010].</p>
<p>The related areas of Scientific Computing and Parallel Computing are rather
more recent fields of study. Basic introductory texts are Scott et al. [2005]
and Tveito and Winter [2009]. Texts relevant to linear algebra and differential
equations are Schendel [1984], Ortega and Voigt [1985], Ortega [1989], Golub
and Ortega [1992], [1993], Van de Velde [1994], Burrage [1995], Heath [1997],
Deuflhard and Bornemann [2002], O’Leary [2009], and Quarteroni et al. [2010].
Other texts address topics in optimization, Pardalos et al. [1992] and Gonnet
and Scholl [2009]; computational geometry, Akl and Lyons [1993]; and other
miscellaneous areas, Crandall [1994], [1996], K¨ockler [1994], Bellomo and Preziosi
[1995], Danaila et al. [2007], and Farin and Hansford [2008]. Interesting historical
essays are contained in Nash, ed. [1990]. Matters regarding the Complexity of
numerical algorithms are discussed in an abstract framework in books by Traub and
Wo´zniakowski [1980] and Traub, Wasilkowski, and Wo´zniakowski [1983], [1988],
with applications to the numerical integration of functions and nonlinear equations,
and similarly, applied to elliptic partial differential equations and integral equations,
in the book by Werschulz [1991]. Other treatments are those by Kronsj¨o [1987], Ko
[1991], Bini and Pan [1994], Wang et al. [1994], Traub and Werschulz [1998], Ritter
[2000], and Novak et al. [2009]. For an in-depth complexity analysis of Newton’s
method, the reader is encouraged to study Smale’s [1987] lecture.</p>
<p>Material on Computational Number Theory can be found, at the undergraduate
level, in the book by Rosen [2000], which also contains applications to cryptography
and computer science, and in Allenby and Redfern [1989], and at a more advanced
level in the books by Niven et al. [1991], Cohen [1993], and Bach and Shallit
[1996]. Computational methods of factorization are dealt with in the book by
Riesel [1994]. Other useful sources are the set of lecture notes by Pohst [1993]
on algebraic number theory algorithms, and the proceedings volumes edited by
Pomerance [1990] and Gautschi [1994a, Part II]. For algorithms in Combinatorics,
see the books by Nijenhuis and Wilf [1978], Hu and Shing [2002], and Cormen et
al. [2009]. Various aspects of Computer Algebra are treated in the books by Geddes
et al. [1992], Mignotte [1992], Davenport et al. [1993], Mishra [1993], Heck [2003],
and Cox et al. [2007].</p>
<p>Other relatively new disciplines are Computational Geometry and Geometric
Modeling, Computer-Aided Design, and Computational Topology, for which rel-
evant texts are, respectively, Preparata and Shamos [1985], Edelsbrunner [1987],
M¨antyl¨a [1988], Taylor [1992], McLeod and Baart [1998], Gallier [2000], Cohen et
al. [2001], and Salomon [2006]; Hoschek and Lasser [1993], Farin [1997], [1999],
and Prautsch et al. [2002]; Edelsbrunner [2006], and Edelsbrunner and Harer [2010].
Statistical Computing is covered in general textbooks such as Kennedy and Gentle
[1980], Anscombe [1981], Maindonald [1984], Thisted [1988], Monahan [2001],
Gentle [2009], and Lange [2010]. More specialized texts are Devroye [1986] and
H¨ormann et al. [2004] on the generation of nonuniform random variables, Sp¨ath
[1992] on regression analysis, Heiberger [1989] on the design of experiments,
Stewart [1994] on Markov chains, Xiu [2010] on stochastic computing and uncer-
tainty quantification, and Fang and Wang [1994], Manno [1999], Gentle [2003],
Liu [2008], Shonkwiler and Mendivil [2009], and Lemieux [2009] on Monte Carlo
and number-theoretic methods. Numerical techniques in Optimization (including
optimal control problems) are discussed in Evtushenko [1985]. An introductory
book on unconstrained optimization is Wolfe [1978]; among more advanced and
broader texts on optimization techniques we mention Gill et al. [1981], Ciarlet
[1989], and Fletcher [2001]. Linear programming is treated in Nazareth [1987] and
Panik [1996], linear and quadratic problems in Sima [1996], and the application of
conjugate direction methods to problems in optimization in Hestenes [1980]. The
most comprehensive text on (numerical and applied) Complex Analysis is the three-
volume treatise by Henrici [1988, 1991, 1986]. Numerical methods for conformal
mapping are also treated in Kythe [1998], Schinzinger and Laura [2003], and
Papamichael and Stylianopoulos [2010]. For approximation in the complex domain,
the standard text is Gaier [1987]; Stenger [1993] deals with approximation by
sinc functions, Stenger [2011] providing some 450 Matlab programs. The book by
Iserles and Nørsett [1991] contains interesting discussions on the interface between
complex rational approximation and the stability theory of discretized differential
equations. The impact of high-precision computation on problems and conjectures
involving complex approximation is beautifully illustrated in the set of lectures by
Varga [1990].</p>
<p>For an in-depth treatment of many of the preceding topics, also see the four-
volume work of Knuth [1975, 1981, 1973, 2005–2006].
Perhaps the most significant topic omitted in our book is numerical linear algebra
and its application to solving partial differential equations by finite difference or
finite element methods. Fortunately, there are many treatises available that address
these areas. For Numerical Linear Algebra, we refer to the classic work of Wilkinson
[1988] and the book by Golub and Van Loan [1996]. Links and applications
of matrix computation to orthogonal polynomials and quadrature are the subject
of Golub and Meurant [2010]. Other general texts are Jennings and McKeown
[1992], Watkins [2002], [2007], Demmel [1997], Trefethen and Bau [1997], Stewart
[1973], [1998], Meurant [1999], White [2007], Allaire and Kaber [2008], and
Datta [2010]; Higham [2002], [2008] has a comprehensive treatment of error and
stability analyses and the first, equally extensive, treatment of the numerics of matrix
functions. Solving linear systems on vector and shared memory parallel computers
and the use of linear algebra packages on high-performance computers are discussed
in Dongarra et al. [1991], [1998]. The solution of sparse linear systems and the
special data structures and pivoting strategies required in direct methods are treated
in Østerby and Zlatev [1983], Duff et al. [1989], Zlatev [1991], and Davis [2006],
whereas iterative techniques are discussed in the classic texts by Young [2003]
and Varga [2000], and in Il’in [1992], Hackbusch [1994], Weiss [1996], Fischer
[1996], Brezinski [1997], Greenbaum [1997], Saad [2003], Broyden and Vespucci
[2004], Hageman and Young [2004], Meurant [2006], Chan and Jin [2007], Byrne
[2008], and Wo´znicki [2009]. The books by Branham [1990] and Bj¨orck [1996]
are devoted especially to least squares problems. For eigenvalues, see Chatelin
[1983], [1993], and for a good introduction to the numerical analysis of symmetric
eigenvalue problems, see Parlett [1998]. The currently very active investigation of
large sparse symmetric and nonsymmetric eigenvalue problems and their solution
by Lanczos-type methods has given rise to many books, for example, Cullum and
Willoughby [1985], [2002], Meyer [1987], Sehmi [1989], and Saad [1992]. For
structured and symplectic eigenvalue problems, see Fassbender [2000] and Kressner
[2005], and for inverse eigenvalue problems, Xu [1998] and Chu and Golub [2005].
For readers wishing to test their algorithms on specific matrices, the collection of
test matrices in Gregory and Karney [1978] and the “matrix market” on the Web
(<a class="reference external" href="http://math.nist.gov./MatrixMarket">http://math.nist.gov./MatrixMarket</a>) are useful sources.</p>
<p>Even more extensive is the textbook literature on the numerical solution of Par-
tial Differential Equations. The field has grown so much that there are currently only
a few books that attempt to cover the subject more or less as a whole. Among these
are Birkhoff and Lynch [1984] (for elliptic problems), Hall and Porsching [1990],
Ames [1992], Celia and Gray [1992], Larsson and Thom´ee [2003], Quarteroni and
Valli [1994], Morton and Mayers [2005], Sewell [2005], Quarteroni [2009], and
Tveito and Winter [2009]. Variational and finite element methods seem to have
attracted the most attention. An early and still frequently cited reference is the
book by Ciarlet [2002] (a reprint of the 1978 original); among more recent texts
we mention Beltzer [1990] (using symbolic computation), K˘r´ı˘zek and Neittaanm¨aki
[1990], Brezzi and Fortin [1991], Schwab [1998], Kwon and Bang [2000] (using
Matlab), Zienkiewicz and Taylor [2000], Axelsson and Barker [2001], Babuˇska
and Strouboulis [2001], H¨ollig [2003], Monk [2003] (for Maxwell’s equation),
Ern and Guermonde [2004], Kythe and Wei [2004], Reddy [2004], Chen [2005],
Elman et al. [2005], Thom´ee [2006] (for parabolic equations), Braess [2007],
Demkowicz [2007], Brenner and Scott [2008], Bochev and Gunzburger [2009],
Efendiev and Hou [2009], and Johnson [2009]. Finite difference methods are treated
in Ashyralyev and Sobolevski˘ı [1994], Gustafsson et al. [1995], Thomas [1995],
[1999], Samarskii [2001], Strikwerda [2004], LeVeque [2007], and Gustafsson
[2008]; the method of lines in Schiesser [1991]; and the more refined techniques
of multigrids and domain decomposition in McCormick [1989], [1992], Bramble
[1993], Sha˘ıdurov [1995], Smith et al. [1996], Quarteroni and Valli [1999], Briggs
et al. [2000], Toselli and Widlund [2005], and Mathew [2008]. Problems in potential
theory and elasticity are often approached via boundary element methods, for which
representative texts are Brebbia and Dominguez [1992], Chen and Zhou [1992],
Hall [1994], and Steinbach [2008]. A discussion of conservation laws is given in the
classic monograph by Lax [1973] and more recently in LeVeque [1992], Godlewski
and Raviart [1996], Kr¨oner [1997], and LeVeque [2002]. Spectral methods, i.e.,
expansions in (typically) orthogonal polynomials, applied to a variety of problems,
were pioneered in the monograph by Gottlieb and Orszag [1977] and have received
extensive treatments in more recent texts by Canuto et al. [1988], [2006], [2007],
Fornberg [1996], Guo [1998], Trefethen [2000] (in Matlab), Boyd [2001], Peyret
[2002], Hesthaven et al. [2007], and Kopriva [2009].</p>
<p>Early, but still relevant, texts on the numerical solution of Integral Equations are
Atkinson [1976] and Baker [1977]. More recent treatises are Atkinson [1997] and
Kythe and Puri [2002]. Volterra integral equations are dealt with by Brunner and van
der Houwen [1986] and Brunner [2004], whereas singular integral equations are the
subject of Pr¨ossdorf and Silbermann [1991].</p>

<h2>Chapter 1  Machine Arithmetic and Related Matters<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-1-machine-arithmetic-and-related-matters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The questions addressed in this first chapter are fundamental in the sense that they are relevant in any situation that involves numerical machine computation, regardless of the kind of problem that gave rise to these computations. In the first place, one has to be aware of the rather primitive type of number system available on computers. It is basically a finite system of numbers of finite length, thus a far cry from the idealistic number system familiar to us from mathematical analysis. The passage from a real number to a machine number entails rounding, and thus small errors, called roundoff errors. Additional errors are introduced when the individual arithmetic operations are carried out on the computer. In themselves, these errors are harmless, but acting in concert and propagating through a lengthy computation, they can have significant – even disastrous – effects.</p>
<p>Most problems involve input data not representable exactly on the computer. Therefore, even before the solution process starts, simply by storing the input in computer memory, the problem is already slightly perturbed, owing to the necessity of rounding the input. It is important, then, to estimate how such small perturbations in the input affect the output, the solution of the problem. This is the question of the (numerical) condition of a problem: the problem is called well conditioned if the changes in the solution of the problem are of the same order of magnitude as the perturbations in the input that caused those changes. If, on the other hand, they are much larger, the problem is called ill conditioned. It is desirable to measure by a single number – the condition number of the problem – the extent to which the solution is sensitive to perturbations in the input. The larger this number, the more ill conditioned the problem.</p>
<p>Once the solution process starts, additional rounding errors will be committed, which also contaminate the solution. The resulting errors, in contrast to those caused by input errors, depend on the particular solution algorithm. It makes sense, therefore, to also talk about the condition of an algorithm, although its analysis is usually quite a bit harder. The quality of the computed solution is then determined by both (essentially the product of) the condition of the problem and the condition of the algorithm.</p>

<h2>1.1 Real Numbers, Machine Numbers, and Rounding<a class="headerlink" href="#real-numbers-machine-numbers-and-rounding" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We begin with the number system commonly used in mathematical analysis and confront it with the more primitive number system available to us on any particular computer. We identify the basic constant (the machine precision) that determines the level of precision attainable on such a computer.</p>
<p>1.1.1 Real Numbers</p>
<p>One can introduce real numbers in many different ways. Mathematicians favor the axiomatic approach, which leads them to define the set of real numbers as a “complete Archimedean ordered field.” Here we adopt a more pedestrian attitude and consider the set of real numbers R to consist of positive and negative numbers represented in some appropriate number system and manipulated in the usual manner known from elementary arithmetic. We adopt here the binary number system, since it is the one most commonly used on computers. Thus,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[x \in R \text{ iff } x = \pm (b_n2^n + b_{n-1}2^{n-1}+ ... + b_0 + b_{-1}2^{-1} +  b_{-2}2^{-2} + ...) (1.1)\]</div>
<p>Here <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n \geq 0\)</span> is some integer, and the “binary digits” bi are either 0 or 1,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[b_i = 0 \text{ or } b_i = 1 \text{ for all i}. (1.2)\]</div>
<p>It is important to note that in general we need infinitely many binary digits to represent a real number. We conveniently write such a number in the abbreviated form (familiar from the decimal number system)</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[x = \pm (b_nb:{n-1} ... b_0.b_{-1}b_{-2}b_{-3}...)_ 2; (1.3)\]</div>
<p>where the subscript 2 at the end is to remind us that we are dealing with a binary number. (Without this subscript, the number could also be read as a decimal number, which would be a source of ambiguity.) The dot in (1.3) – appropriately called the binary point – separates the integer part on the left from the fractional part on the right. Note that representation (1.3) is not unique, for example, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((.0.011\bar{1}...)_2=(0.1)_2\)</span>. We regain uniqueness if we always insist on a finite representation, if one exists.</p>
<p>Examples.1. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((10011.01)_2=2^4+2^1+2^0+2^{-2}=16+2+1+\frac{1}{4}=(19.25)_{10}\)</span></p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((.0101\bar{01}...)_2 = \sum_{k=2 \ (k even)}^{\infty} 2^{-k} = \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} 2^{-2m} = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} (\frac{1}{4})^m\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{1}{4} \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{4}}=\frac{1}{3} = (0.33\bar{3}...)_{10}\)</span></p>

</ol>
<p>To determine the binary digits on the right, one keeps multiplying by 2 and observing the integer part in the result; if it is zero, the binary digit in question is 0, otherwise 1. In the latter case, the integral part is removed and the process repeated.</p>
<p>The last example is of interest insofar as it shows that to a finite decimal number there may correspond a (nontrivial) infinite binary representation. One cannot assume, therefore, that a finite decimal number is exactly representable on a binary computer. Conversely, however, to a finite binary number there always corresponds a finite decimal representation. (Why?)</p>
<p><strong>1.1.2 Machine Numbers</strong></p>
<p>There are two kinds of machine numbers: floating point and fixed point. The first corresponds to the “scientific notation” in the decimal system, whereby a number is written as a decimal fraction times an integral power of 10. The second allows only for fractions. On a binary computer, one consistently uses powers of 2 instead of 10. More important, the number of binary digits, both in the fraction and in the exponent of 2 (if any), is finite and cannot exceed certain limits that are characteristics of the particular computer at hand.</p>
<p><strong>1.1.2.1 Floating-Point Numbers</strong></p>
<p>We denote by t the number of binary digits allowed by the computer in the fractional part and by s the number of binary digits in the exponent. Then the set of (real) floating-point numbers on that computer will be denoted by R.t; s/. Thus,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[x \in R(t,s) \text{ iff }  x=f \cdot 2^3,\]</div>
<p>where, in the notation of (1.3),</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[f= \pm (.b_{-1}b_{-2} ... b_{-t})_2,  e=\pm (c_{s-1}c_{s-2} ... c_0)_2: (1.5)\]</div>
<p>Here all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b_i\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_j\)</span> are binary digits, that is, either zero or one. The binary fraction f is usually referred to as the mantissa of x and the integer e as the exponent of x. The number x in (1.4) is said to be normalized if in its fraction f we have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b_{-1}=1\)</span>. We assume that all numbers in R(t,s) are normalized (with the exception of x =0, which is treated as a special number). If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x \neq 0\)</span> were not normalized, we could</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Fig. 1.1 Packing of a floating-point number in a machine register</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>multiply f by an appropriate power of 2, to normalize it, and adjust the exponent accordingly. This is always possible as long as the adjusted exponent is still in the admissible range.</p>
<p>We can think of a floating-point number (1.4) as being accommodated in a machine register as shown in Fig. 1.1. The figure does not quite correspond to reality, but is close enough to it for our purposes.</p>
<p>Note that the set (1.4) of normalized floating-point numbers is finite and is thus represented by a finite set of points on the real line. What is worse, these points are not uniformly distributed (cf. Ex. 1). This, then, is all we have to work with!</p>
<p>It is immediately clear from (1.4) and (1.5) that the largest and smallest magnitude of a (normalized) floating-point number is given, respectively, by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[max_{x \in R(t,s)} |x| = (1-2^{-t})2^{2^s}-1}, min_{x \in R(t,s)} |x| = 2^{-2^s}\]</div>
<p>On a Sun Sparc workstation, for example, one has t = 23, s = 7, so that the maximum and minimum in (1.6) are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.70 \times 10^{38}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2.94 \times 10^{-39}\)</span>, respectively. (Because of an asymmetric internal hardware representation of the exponent on these computers, the true range of floating-point numbers is slightly shifted, more like from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.18 \times 10^{38}\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3.40 \times 10^{38}\)</span>.) Matlab arithmetic, essentially double precision, uses t D 53 and s D 10, which greatly expands the number range from something like <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{-308}\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{+308}\)</span>.</p>
<p>A real nonzero number whose modulus is not in the range determined by (1.6) cannot be represented on this particular computer. If such a number is produced during the course of a computation, one says that overflow has occurred if its modulus is larger than the maximum in (1.6) and underflow if it is smaller than the minimum in (1.6). The occurrence of overflow is fatal, and the machine (or its operating system) usually prompts the computation to be interrupted. Underflow is less serious, and one may get away with replacing the delinquent number by zero. However, this is not foolproof. Imagine that at the next step the number that underflowed is to be multiplied by a huge number. If the replacement by zero has been made, the result will always be zero.</p>
<p>To increase the precision, one can use two machine registers to represent a machine number. In effect, one then embeds <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{R}(t,s) \subset \mathbb{R}(2t,s)\)</span>, and calls <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x \in \mathbb{R}(2t,s)\)</span> a double-precision number.</p>
<p>Fig. 1.2 Packing of a fixed-point number in a machine register</p>
<p><strong>1.1.2.2 Fixed-Point Numbers</strong></p>
<p>This is the case (1.4) where e = 0. That is, fixed-point numbers are binary fractions, x = f , hence <a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">|f|</span></a> &lt; 1. We can therefore only deal with numbers that are in the interval (–1,1). This, in particular, requires extensive scaling and rescaling to make sure that all initial data, as well as all intermediate and final results, lie in that interval. Such a complication can only be justified in special circumstances where machine time and/or precision is at a premium. Note that on the same computer as considered before, we do not need to allocate space for the exponent in the machine register, and thus have in effect s C t binary digits available for the fraction f , hence more precision; cf. Fig. 1.2.</p>
<p><strong>1.1.2.3 Other Data Structures for Numbers</strong></p>
<p>Complex floating-point numbers consist of pairs of real floating-point numbers, the first of the pair representing the real part and the second the imaginary part. To avoid rounding errors in arithmetic operations altogether, one can employ rational arithmetic, in which each (rational) number is represented by a pair of extended-precision integers – the numerator and denominator of the rational number. The Euclidean algorithm is used to remove common factors. A device that allows keeping track of error propagation and the influence of data errors is interval arithmetic involving intervals guaranteed to contain the desired numbers. In complex arithmetic, one employs rectangular or circular domains.</p>
<p><strong>1.1.3 Rounding</strong></p>
<p>A machine register acts much like the infamous Procrustes bed in Greek mythology. Procrustes was the innkeeper whose inn had only beds of one size. If a fellow came along who was too tall to fit into his beds, he cut off his feet. If the fellow was too short, he stretched him. In the same way, if a real number comes along that is too long, its tail end (not the head) is cutoff; if it is too short, it is padded by zeros at the end.</p>
<p>More specifically, let</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}  x \in \mathbb{R}, x=\pm (\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_{-k}2^{-k})2^e\\be the “exact” real number (in normalized floating-point form) and\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[x* \in \mathbb{R}, x*=\pm (\sum_{k=1}^{t} b*_{-k}2^{-k})2^{e*}\]</div>
<p>the rounded number. One then distinguishes between two methods of rounding, the first being Procrustes’ method.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Chopping.Onetakes</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[x* = chop(x), e*= e, b*_{-k} =  b_{-k} \text{ for } k = 1, 2, ..., t\]</div>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="2">
<li><p>Symmetric rounding. This corresponds to the familiar rounding up or rounding down in decimal arithmetic, based on the first discarded decimal digit: if it is larger than or equal to 5, one rounds up; if it is less than 5, one rounds down. In binary arithmetic, the procedure is somewhat simpler, since there are only two possibilities: either the first discarded binary digit is 1, in which case one rounds up, or it is 0, in which case one rounds down. We can write the procedure very simply in terms of the chop operation in (1.9):</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[x*= rd(x), rd(x) := chop(x + \frac{1}{2} \dot 2^{-t} \dot 2^e).\]</div>
<p>There is a small error incurred in rounding, which is most easily estimated in the case of chopping. Here the absolute error <a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">|x- x*|</span></a> is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}|x-chop(x)| = |\pm \sum_{k=t+1}^{\infty} b_{-k} 2^{-k}|2^e\\\leq \sum_{k=t+1}^{\infty} 2^{-k} \dot 2^e = 2^{-t} \dot 2^e\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>It depends on e (i.e., the magnitude of x), which is the reason why one prefers the relative error <a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">|(x x*)/x|</span></a> (if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x \neq 0\)</span>), which, for normalized x, can be estimated as</p>

<p>it determines the level of precision of any large-scale floating-point computation. In Matlab double-precision arithmetic, one has t = 53, so that eps 1:11 1016 (cf. Ex. 5), corresponding to a precision of 15–16 significant decimal digits.</p>

<p>rd.x/Dx.1C”/; j”jeps; (1.14) and defers dealing with the inequality (for “) to the very end.</p>
<p>1.2 Machine Arithmetic</p>
<p>The arithmetic used on computers unfortunately does not respect the laws of ordinary arithmetic. Each elementary floating-point operation, in general, generates a small error that may then propagate through subsequent machine operations. As a rule, this error propagation is harmless, except in the case of subtraction, where cancellation effects may seriously compromise the accuracy of the results.</p>
<p>1.2.1 A Model of Machine Arithmetic</p>
<p>Any of the four basic arithmetic operations, when applied to two machine numbers, may produce a result no longer representable on the computer. We have therefore errors also associated with arithmetic operations. Barring the occurrence of overflow or underflow, we may assume as a model of machine arithmetic that each arithmetic operation ı .D C; ; ; =/ produces a correctly rounded result. Thus, if x; y 2 R.t;s/ are floating-point machine numbers, and fl.xıy/ denotes the machine- produced result of the arithmetic operation xıy, then</p>
<p>fl.xıy/Dxıy.1C”/; j”jeps: (1.15)</p>
<p>ˇˇ x</p>
<p>8 1 Machine Arithmetic and Related Matters</p>
<p>This can be interpreted in a number of ways, for example, in the case of multiplication,</p>
<p>pp fl.xy/DŒx.1C”/yDxŒy.1C”/D.x 1C”/.y 1C”/D:</p>
<p>In each equation we identify the computed result as the exact result on data that are slightly perturbed, whereby the respective relative perturbations can be estimated,</p>
<p>pˇˇ forexample,byj”jepsinthefirsttwoequations,and 1C1C12”,ˇ12”ˇ</p>
<p>12 eps in the third. These are elementary examples of backward error analysis, a powerful tool for estimating errors in machine computation (cf. also Sect. 1.3).</p>
<p>Even though a single arithmetic operation causes a small error that can be neglected, a succession of arithmetic operations can well result in a significant error, owing to error propagation. It is like the small microorganisms that we all carry in our bodies: if our defense mechanism is in good order, the microorganisms cause no harm, in spite of their large presence. If for some reason our defenses are weakened, then all of a sudden they can play havoc with our health. The same is true in machine computation: the rounding errors, although widespread, will cause little harm unless our computations contain some weak spots that allow rounding errors to take over to the point of completely invalidating the results. We learn about one such weak spot (indeed the only one) in the next section.1</p>
<p>1.2.2 Error Propagation in Arithmetic Operations: Cancellation Error</p>
<p>We now study the extent to which the basic arithmetic operations propagate errors already present in their operands. Previously, in Sect. 1.2.1, we assumed the</p>
<p>1Rounding errors can also have significant implications in real life. One example, taken from politics, concerns the problem of apportionment: how should the representatives in an assembly, such as the US House of Representatives or the Electoral College, be constituted to fairly reflect the size of population in the various states? If the total number of representatives in the assembly is given, say, A, the total population of the US is P , and the population of State i is pi , then State i should be allocated</p>
<p>ri D pi A P</p>
<p>representatives. The problem is that ri is not an integer, in general. How then should ri be rounded</p>
<p>to an integer ri ? One can think of three natural criteria to be imposed: (1) ri should be one of the two integers closest to ri (“quota condition”). (2) If A is increased, all other things being</p>
<p>the same, then ri should not decrease (“house monotonicity”). (3) If pi is increased, the other pj</p>
<p>remaining constant, then ri should not decrease (“population monotonicity”). Unfortunately, there is no apportionment method that satisfies all three criteria. There is indeed a case in US history when Samuel J. Tilden lost his bid for the presidency in 1876 in favor of Rutherford B. Hayes, purely on the basis of the apportionment method adopted on that occasion (which, incidentally, was not the one prescribed by law at the time).</p>
<p>1.2 Machine Arithmetic 9</p>
<p>operands to be exact machine-representable numbers and discussed the errors due to imperfect execution of the arithmetic operations by the computer. We now change our viewpoint and assume that the operands themselves are contaminated by errors, but the arithmetic operations are carried out exactly. (We already know what to do, cf. (1.15), when we are dealing with machine operations.) Our interest is in the errors in the results caused by errors in the data.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Multiplication. We consider values x.1 C “x/ and y.1 C “y/ of x and y contaminated by relative errors “x and “y , respectively. What is the relative error in the product?

<p>The cancellation phenomenon</p>
<p>As before, the error in the result is a linear combination of the errors in the data, but now the coefficients are no longer ̇1 but can assume values that are arbitrarily large. Note first, however, that when x and y have the same sign, then both coefficients are positive and bounded by 1, so that</p>
<p>j”xCyj  j”xj C j”yj .x y &gt; 0/I (1.19)</p>
<p>addition, in this case, is again a benign operation. It is only when x and y have opposite signs that the coefficients in (1.18) can be arbitrarily large, namely, when jx C yj is arbitrarily small compared to jxj and jyj. This happens when x and y are almost equal in absolute value, but opposite in sign. The large magnification of error then occurring in (1.18) is referred to as cancellation error. It is the only serious weakness – the Achilles heel, as it were – of numerical computation, and it should be avoided whenever possible. In particular, one should be prepared to encounter cancellation effects not only in single devastating amounts, but also repeatedly over a long period of time involving “small doses” of cancellation. Either way, the end result can be disastrous.</p>
<p>We illustrate the cancellation phenomenon schematically in Fig. 1.3, where b, b0, b00 stand for binary digits that are reliable, and the g represent binary digits contaminated by error; these are often called “garbage” digits. Note in Fig. 1.3 that “garbage – garbage D garbage,” but, more importantly, that the final normalization of the result moves the first garbage digit from the 12th position to the 3rd.</p>
<p>Cancellation is such a serious matter that we wish to give a number of elementary examples, not only of its occurrence, but also of how it might be avoided.</p>
<p>Examples. 1. An algebraic identity: .a b/2 D a2 2ab C b2. Although this is a valid identity in algebra, it is no longer valid in machine arithmetic. Thus, on a 2-decimal-digit computer, with a D 1.8, b D 1.7, we get, using symmetric rounding,</p>
<p>fl.a2 2abCb2/D3:26:2C2:9D0:10</p>
<p>instead of the true result 0.010, which we obtain also on our 2-digit computer if we use the left-hand side of the identity. The expanded form of the square thus produces a result which is off by one order of magnitude and on top has the wrong sign.</p>

<dl class="simple">
<dt>We may thus think of a problem as a map f , given by</dt><dd><p>f W Rm ! Rn; y D f .x/: (1.20)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>(One or both of the spaces Rm, Rn could be complex spaces without changing in any essential way the discussion that follows.) What we are interested in is the sensitivity of the map f at some given point x to a small perturbation of x, that is, how much bigger (or smaller) the perturbation in y is compared to the perturbation in x. In particular, we wish to measure the degree of sensitivity by a single number – the condition number of the map f at the point x. We emphasize that, as we perturb x, the function f is always assumed to be evaluated exactly, with infinite precision. The condition of f , therefore, is an inherent property of the map f and does not depend on any algorithmic considerations concerning its implementation.</p>
<p>This is not to say that knowledge of the condition of a problem is irrelevant to any algorithmic solution of the problem. On the contrary, the reason is that quite often the computed solution y of (1.20) (computed in floating-point machine arithmetic, using a specific algorithm) can be demonstrated to be the exact solution to a “nearby” problem, that is,</p>
<p>y D f .x/; (1.21) where x is a vector close to the given data x,</p>
<p>x DxCı; (1.22)</p>
<p>and moreover, the distance kık of x to x can be estimated in terms of the machine precision. Therefore, if we know how strongly (or weakly) the map f reacts to a small perturbation, such as ı in (1.22), we can say something about the error y y in the solution caused by this perturbation. This, indeed, is an important technique of error analysis – known as backward error analysis – which was pioneered in the 1950s by J. W. Givens, C. Lanczos, and, above all, J. H. Wilkinson.</p>
<p>Maps f between more general spaces (in particular, function spaces) have also been considered from the point of view of conditioning, but eventually, these spaces have to be reduced to finite-dimensional spaces for practical implementation of the maps in question.</p>

<p>write this in the form</p>
<p>y xf0.x/ x : (1.24) y f.x/ x</p>
<p>The approximate equality becomes a true equality in the limit as x ! 0. This suggests that the condition of f at x be defined by the quantity</p>

</dl>
<p>This number tells us how much larger the relative perturbation in y is compared to the relative perturbation in x.</p>
<p>If x D 0 and y ¤ 0, it is more meaningful to consider the absolute error measure for x and for y still the relative error. This leads to the condition number jf 0.x/=f.x/j. Similarly for y D 0, x ¤ 0. If x D y D 0, the condition number by (1.23) would then simply be jf 0.x/j.</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>We assume again that each function f has partial derivatives with respect to all m variables at the point x. Then the most detailed analysis departs from considering each component y as a function of one single variable, x. In other words, we subject only one variable, x, to a small change and observe the resulting change in just one component, y . Then we can apply (1.25) and obtain</p>

<p>.x/WD.cond f/.x/WDˇ &#64;x ˇ : (1.27)  ˇf.x/ˇ</p>
<p>14 1 Machine Arithmetic and Related Matters This gives us a whole matrix .x/ D Œ.x/ 2 Rnm of condition numbers.</p>
<p>To obtain a single condition number, we can take any convenient measure of the “magnitude” of the matrix .x/ such as one of the matrix norms defined in (1.30),</p>
<p>.condf /.x/ D k.x/k; .x/ D Œ.x/: (1.28)</p>
<p>The condition so defined, of course, depends on the choice of norm, but the order of magnitude (and that is all that counts) should be more or less the same for any reasonable norm.</p>
<p>If a component of x, or of y, vanishes, one modifies (1.27) as discussed earlier.</p>
<p>A less-refined analysis can be modeled after the one-dimensional case by defining the relative perturbation of x 2 Rm to mean</p>
<p>kxkRm; xDŒx1;x2;:::;xmT; (1.29) kxkRm</p>
<p>where x is a perturbation vector whose components x are small compared to x,andwherekkRm issomevectornorminRm.Fortheperturbationycausedby x, one defines similarly the relative perturbation kykRn =kykRn , with a suitable vector norm k  kRn in Rn. One then tries to relate the relative perturbation in y to the one in x.</p>
<p>To carry this out, one needs to define a matrix norm for matrices A 2 Rnm. We choose the so-called “operator norm,”</p>
<dl class="simple">

<p>Clearly, in the case m D n D 1, definition (1.35) reduces precisely to definition (1.25) (as well as (1.28)) given earlier. In higher dimensions (m and/or n larger than 1), however, the condition number in (1.35) is much cruder than the one in (1.28). This is because norms tend to destroy detail: if x, for example, has components</p>

<p>We now have what appears to be a practical scheme to compute In: start with y0 D I0 given by (1.36) and then apply in succession (1.38) for k D 1;2;:::;n; then yn D In. Recursion (1.38), for any starting value y0, defines a function,</p>

Indeed, I0 in (1.36) is not machine representable and must be rounded to I0 before recursion (1.38) can be employed. Even if no further errors are introduced during the recursion, the final result will not be exactly In, but some approximation In D fn.I0/, and we have, at least approximately (actually exactly; see the remark after (1.46)),</p>

<p>We see that fn.y0/ is severely ill-conditioned at y0 D I0, the more so the larger n.</p>
<p>We could have anticipated this result by just looking at the recursion (1.38): we keep multiplying by (–5), which tends to make things bigger, whereas they should get smaller. Thus, there will be continuous cancellation occurring throughout the recursion.</p>
<p>How can we avoid this ill-conditioning? The clue comes from the remark just made: instead of multiplying by a large number, we would prefer dividing by a large number, especially if the results get bigger at the same time. This is accomplished by reversing recurrence (1.38), that is, by choosing an &gt; n and computing</p>

<p>The example teaches us that the roots of an algebraic equation written in the form (1.50) can be extremely sensitive to small changes in the coefficients a . It would, therefore, be ill-advised to express every polynomial in terms of powers, as in (1.56) and (1.50). This is particularly true for characteristic polynomials of matrices. It is much better here to work with the matrices themselves and try to reduce them (by similarity transformations) to a form that allows the eigenvalues – the roots of the characteristic equation – to be read off relatively easily.</p>

Hilbert’s fundamental contributions to almost all parts of mathematics – algebra, number theory, geometry, integral equations, calculus of variations, and foundations – and in particular the 23 now famous problems he proposed in 1900 at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris gave a new impetus, and new directions, to 20th-century mathematics. Hilbert is also known for his work in mathematical physics, where among other things he formulated a variationl principle for Einstein’s equations in the theory of relativity.</p>

<p>This is clearly a symmetric matrix, and it is also positive definite. Some numerical values for the condition number of Hn, computed with the Euclidean norm,3 are shown in Table 1.1. Their rapid growth is devastating.</p>

<p>A system of order n D 10, for example, cannot be solved with any reliability in single precision on a 14-decimal computer. Double precision will be “exhausted” by the time we reach nD 20. The Hilbert matrix thus is a prototype of an ill-conditioned matrix. From a result of G. Szego ̋ it can be seen that</p>

<p>4Alexandre The ́ophile Vandermonde (1735–1796), a musician by training, but through acquain- tance with Fontaine turned mathematician (temporarily), and even elected to the French Academy of Sciences, produced a total of four mathematical papers within 3 years (1770–1772). Though written by a novice to mathematics, they are not without interest. The first, e.g., made notable contributions to the then emerging theory of equations. By virtue of his fourth paper, he is regarded as the founder of the theory of determinants. What today is referred to as “Vandermonde determinant,” however, does not appear anywhere in his writings. As a member of the Academy, he sat in a committee (together with Lagrange, among others) that was to define the unit of length – the meter. Later in his life, he became an ardent supporter of the French revolution.</p>

<p>1.4 The Condition of an Algorithm 25</p>
<p>Along with the problem f , we are also given an algorithm A that “solves” the problem. That is, given a machine vector x 2 Rm.t;s/, the algorithm A produces a vector yA (in machine arithmetic) that is supposed to approximate y D f .x/. Thus, we have another map fA describing how the problem f is solved by the algorithm A,</p>
<p>fA W Rm.t; s/ ! Rn.t; s/; yA D fA.x/: (1.63) In order to be able to analyze fA in these general terms, we must make a basic</p>
<p>assumption, namely, that</p>
<p>for every x 2 Rm.t; s/; there holds</p>
<p>fA.x/Df.xA/ forsome xA 2Rm:</p>
<p>(1.64)</p>
<p>That is, the computed solution corresponding to some input x is the exact solution for some different input xA (not necessarily a machine vector and not necessarily uniquely determined) that we hope is close to x. The closer we can find an xA to x, the more confidence we should place in the algorithm A. We therefore define the condition of A in terms of the xA closest to x (if there is more than one), by comparing its relative error with the machine precision eps:</p>
<p>.cond A/.x/ D inf kxA xk =eps: (1.65) xA kxk</p>
<p>Here the infimum is over all xA satisfying yA D f .xA/. In practice, one can take any such xA and then obtain an upper bound for the condition number:</p>
<p>.cond A/.x/ kxA xk =eps: (1.66) kxk</p>
<p>The vector norm in (1.65), respectively, (1.66), can be chosen as seems convenient. Here are some very elementary examples.</p>

<p>1.6 Notes to Chapter 1</p>
<p>In addition to rounding errors in the data and those committed during the execution of arithmetic operations, there may be other sources of errors not considered in this introductory chapter. One such source of error, which is not entirely dismissible, is a faulty design of the computer chip that executes arithmetic operations. This was brought home in an incident several years ago, when it was discovered (by Thomas Nicely in the course of number-theoretic computations involving reciprocals of twin primes) that the Pentium floating-point divide chip manufactured by Intel can produce erroneous results for certain (extremely rare) bit patterns in the divisor. The incident – rightly so – has stirred up considerable concern and prompted not only remedial actions but also careful analysis of the phenomenon; some relevant articles are those by Coe et al. [1995] and Edelman [1997].</p>
<p>Neither should the occurrence of overflow and proper handling thereof be taken lightly, especially not in real-time applications. Again, a case in point is the failure of the French rocket Ariane 5, which on June 4, 1996, less than a minute into its flight, self-destructed. The failure was eventually traced to an overflow in a floating-point to integer conversion and lack of protection against this occurrence in the rocket’s on-board software (cf. Anonymous [1996]).</p>
<p>Many of the topics covered in this chapter, but also the effect of finite precision computation on convergence and stability of mathematical processes, and issues of error analyses are dealt with in Chaitin-Chatelin and Fraysse ́ [1996].</p>
<p>Section 1.1.1. The abstract notion of the real number system is discussed in most texts on real analysis, for example, Hewitt and Stromberg [1975, Chap. 1, Sect. 1.5] or Rudin [1976, Chap. 1]. The development of the concept of real (and complex) numbers has had a long and lively history, extending from pre-Hellenic times to the recent past. Many of the leading thinkers over time contributed to this development. A reader interested in a detailed historical account (and who knows German) is referred to the monograph by Gericke [1970].</p>
<p>1.6 Notes to Chapter 1 29</p>
<p>Section1.1.2.1. The notion of the floating-point number system and associated arithmetic, including interval arithmetic, can also be phrased in abstract algebraic terms; see, for example, Kulisch and Miranker [1981]. For a comprehensive treat- ment of computer arithmetic, including questions of validation, see Kulisch [2008]. A more elementary, but detailed, discussion of floating-point numbers and arith- metic is given in Sterbenz [1974]. There the reader will learn, for example, that computing the average of two floating-point numbers, or solving a quadratic equation, can be fairly intricate tasks if they are to be made foolproof. The quadratic equation problem is also considered at some length in Young and Gregory [1988,Sect.3.4], where further references are given to earlier work of W. Kahan and G. E. Forsythe.</p>
<p>The basic standard for binary floating-point arithmetic, used on all contemporary computers, is the ANSI/IEEE Standard 754 established in IEEE [1985]. It provides for t D 23 bits in the mantissa and s D 7 bits in the exponent, in single- precision arithmetic, and has t D 52, s D 11 in double precision. There is also an “extended precision” for which t D 63, s D 14, allowing for a number range of approx. 104964 to 10C4964. A good source for IEEE floating-point arithmetic is Overton [2001].</p>
<p>Section1.1.2.3. Rationalarithmeticisavailableinallmajorsymboliccomputation packages such as Mathematica and Macsyma.</p>
<p>Interval arithmetic has evolved to become an important tool in computations that strive at obtaining guaranteed and sharp inclusion regions for the results of mathe- matical problems. Basic texts on (real) interval analysis are Moore [1966], [1979], Alefeld and Herzberger [1983], and Moore et al. [2009], whereas complex interval arithmetic is treated in Petkovic ́ and Petkovic ́ [1998]. For the newly evolving field of validated numerics we refer to Tucker [2011]. Specific applications such as computing inclusions of the range of functions, of global extrema of functions of one and several variables, and of solutions to systems of linear and nonlinear equations are studied, respectively, in Ratschek and Rokne [1984], [1988], Hansen and Walster [2004], and Neumaier [1990]. Other applications, e.g., to parameter estimation, robust control, and robotics can be found in Jaulin et al. [2001]. Concrete algorithms and codes (in Pascal and CCC) for “verified computing” are contained in Hammer et al. [1993], [1995]. Interval arithmetic has been most widely used in processes involving finite-dimensional spaces; for applications to infinite- dimensional problems, notably differential equations, see, however, Eijgenraam [1981] and Kaucher and Miranker [1984]. For a recent expository account, see also Rump [2010].</p>
<p>Section1.2. Forfloating-pointarithmetic,seethehandbookbyMulleretal.[2010]. The fact that thoughtless use of mathematical formulae and numerical methods, or inherent sensitivities in a problem, can lead to disastrous results has been known since the early days of computers; see, for example, the old but still relevant</p>
<p>30 1 Machine Arithmetic and Related Matters</p>
<p>papers by Stegun and Abramowitz [1956] and Forsythe [1970]. Nearby singularities can also cause the accuracy to deteriorate unless corrective measures are taken; Forsythe [1958] has an interesting discussion of this.</p>
<p>Section1.2.1. For the implications of rounding in the problem of apportion- ment, mentioned in footnote 1, a good reference is Garfunkel and Steen, eds. [1988, Chap. 12, pp.230–249].</p>
<p>Section1.3.1. Anearlybutbasicreferenceforideasofconditioninganderroranal- ysis in algebraic processes is Wilkinson [1994]. An impressive continuation of this work, containing copious references to the literature, is Higham [2002]. It analyzes the behavior in floating-point arithmetic of virtually all the algebraic processes in current use. Problems of conditioning specifically involving polynomials are discussed in Gautschi [1984]. The condition of general (differentiable) maps has been studied as early as 1966 in Rice [1966].</p>
<p>Section1.3.2. 1. For a treatment of stability aspects of more general difference equations, and systems thereof, including nonlinear ones, the reader is referred to the monograph by Wimp [1984]. This also contains many applications to special functions. Other relevant texts are Lakshmikantham and Trigiante [2002] and Elaydi [2005].</p>

<p>The condition of algebraic equations, although considered already in 1963 by Wilkinson, has been further analyzed by Gautschi [1973]. The circumstances that led to Wilkinson’s example (1.56), which he himself describes as “the most traumatic experience in [his] career as a numerical analyst,” are related in the essay Wilkinson [1984,Sect.2]. This reference also deals with errors committed in the evaluation and deflation of polynomials. For the latter, also see Cohen [1994]. The asymptotic estimates for the best- and worst-conditioned roots in Wilkinson’s example are from Gautschi [1973]. For the computation of eigenvalues of matrices, the classic treatment is Wilkinson [1988]; more recent accounts are Parlett [1998] for symmetric matrices and Golub and Van Loan [1996, Chap. 7–9] for general matrices.</p>

<p>A more complete analysis of the condition of linear systems that also allows for perturbations of the matrix can be found, for example, in the very readable books by Forsythe and Moler [1967, Chap. 8] and Stewart [1973, Chap. 4, Sect. 3]. The asymptotic result of Szego ̋ cited in connection with the Euclidean condition number of the Hilbert matrix is taken from Szego ̋ [1936]. For the explicit inverse of the Hilbert matrix, referred to in footnote 3, see Todd [1954]. The condition of Vandermonde and Vandermonde-like matrices has been studied in a series of papers by the author; for a summary, see Gautschi [1990], and Gautschi [2011b] for optimally scaled and optimally conditioned Vandermonde and Vandermonde- like matrices.</p>
<p>Sections1.4and1.5. Thetreatmentoftheconditionofalgorithmsandoftheoverall error in computer solutions of problems, as given in these sections, seems to be more or less original. Similar ideas, however, can be found in the book by Dahlquist and Bjo ̈ rck [2008, Sect. 2.4].</p>

<p>Interpretation</p>
<p>Rather consistently, backward summation gives more accurate results than forward summation, by as much as two decimal orders (for s D 11=3 and n D 200 in the case of .s/). For large s (for example s D 10) there is no noticeable difference in accuracy. All this (and more) is consistent with the answers given in part (a). Indeed, the series for the zeta function has terms that are all positive and strictly decreasing, so that by (a1) summation in increasing order of the terms, i.e., backward summation, is more accurate. In the case of the eta series, consider</p>
<p>xD1;yD 1 ;zD 1 : ks .k C 1/s .k C 2/s</p>
<p>Since the function x=.x C 1/ for x &gt; 0 increases monotonically, it follows that jx C yj &gt; jy C zj for all k &gt; 0, and backward summation is more accurate than forward summation. Moreover,</p>
<p>sothattheimprovementjyCzj ofbackwardoverforwardsummationdisappears jxCyj</p>
<p>asymptotically as k ! 1. Also, for large s, the improvement is relatively small, even for only moderately large k.</p>
<p>The same discussion holds for</p>

<p>Because of the behavior of the terms in the sum, when n is large, the accuracy of the sum is largely determined by the accuracy of the terms very near to n. But there, the argument of the tangent is very close to =2. Since</p>
<p>.condtan/.x/Dx.1Ctan2x/; 0&lt;x&lt; =2; tan x</p>
<p>the tangent is very ill-conditioned for x near =2. In fact, for ” &gt; 0 very small,</p>

<p>Since k D n corresponds to ” D n , that is, ” D 2 2nC1</p>

<p>So, for n D 105, for example, we must expect a loss of about five decimal digits. This is confirmed by the numerical results shown above.</p>
<p>The inaccuracy observed cannot be ascribed merely to the large volume of computation. In fact, if we extended the sum only to, say, k D n=2, we would escape the ill-conditioning of the tangent and, even for n D 105, would get more accurate answers. This is shown by the numerical results below.</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>The present chapter is basically concerned with the approximation of functions. The functions in question may be functions defined on a continuum – typically a finite interval – or functions defined only on a finite set of points. The first instance arises, for example, in the context of special functions (elementary or transcendental) that one wishes to evaluate as a part of a subroutine. Since any such evaluation must be reduced to a finite number of arithmetic operations, we must ultimately approximate the function by means of a polynomial or a rational function. The second instance is frequently encountered in the physical sciences when measurements are taken of a certain physical quantity as a function of some other physical quantity (such as time). In either case one wants to approximate the given function “as well as possible” in terms of other simpler functions.</p>
<p>The general scheme of approximation can be described as follows. We are given the function f to be approximated, along with a class ˆ of “approximating functions” ‘ and a “norm” k  k measuring the overall magnitude of functions. We are looking for an approximation ‘O 2 ˆ of f such that</p>
<p>kf ‘Okkf ‘k forall ‘2ˆ: (2.1)</p>
<p>The function ‘O is called the best approximation to f from the class ˆ, relative to the norm k  k.</p>
<p>The class ˆ is called a (real) linear space if with any two functions ‘1, ‘2 2 ˆ it also contains ‘1 C ‘2 and c’1 for any c 2 R, hence also any (finite) linear combination of functions ‘i 2 ˆ. Given n “basis functions” j 2 ˆ, j D 1;2;:::;n, we can define a linear space of finite dimension n by</p>

<p>dealing with functions on bounded domains (finite intervals or finite sets of points). One reason is Weierstrass’s theorem, which states that any continuous function can be approximated on a finite interval as closely as one wishes by a polynomial of sufficiently high degree.</p>
