Quick start guide
This tutorial covers some basic usage patterns and best practices to help you get started with 
Matplotlib.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
A simple example
Matplotlib graphs your data on Figures (e.g., windows, Jupyter widgets, etc.), each of which can 
contain one or more Axes, an area where points can be specified in terms of x-y coordinates (or 
theta-r in a polar plot, x-y-z in a 3D plot, etc.). The simplest way of creating a Figure with an 
Axes is using pyplot.subplots. We can then use Axes.plot to draw some data on the Axes, and show to 
display the figure:

fig, ax = plt.subplots()             # Create a figure containing a single Axes.
ax.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4, 2, 3])  # Plot some data on the Axes.
plt.show()                           # Show the figure.
quick start
Depending on the environment you are working in, plt.show() can be left out. This is for example the 
case with Jupyter notebooks, which automatically show all figures created in a code cell.

Parts of a Figure
Here are the components of a Matplotlib Figure.

../../_images/anatomy.png
Figure
The whole figure. The Figure keeps track of all the child Axes, a group of 'special' Artists 
(titles, figure legends, colorbars, etc.), and even nested subfigures.

Typically, you'll create a new Figure through one of the following functions:

fig = plt.figure()             # an empty figure with no Axes
fig, ax = plt.subplots()       # a figure with a single Axes
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2)  # a figure with a 2x2 grid of Axes
# a figure with one Axes on the left, and two on the right:
fig, axs = plt.subplot_mosaic([['left', 'right_top'],
                               ['left', 'right_bottom']])
subplots() and subplot_mosaic are convenience functions that additionally create Axes objects inside 
the Figure, but you can also manually add Axes later on.

For more on Figures, including panning and zooming, see Introduction to Figures.

Axes
An Axes is an Artist attached to a Figure that contains a region for plotting data, and usually 
includes two (or three in the case of 3D) Axis objects (be aware of the difference between Axes and 
Axis) that provide ticks and tick labels to provide scales for the data in the Axes. Each Axes also 
has a title (set via set_title()), an x-label (set via set_xlabel()), and a y-label set via 
set_ylabel()).

The Axes methods are the primary interface for configuring most parts of your plot (adding data, 
controlling axis scales and limits, adding labels etc.).

Axis
These objects set the scale and limits and generate ticks (the marks on the Axis) and ticklabels 
(strings labeling the ticks). The location of the ticks is determined by a Locator object and the 
ticklabel strings are formatted by a Formatter. The combination of the correct Locator and Formatter 
gives very fine control over the tick locations and labels.

Artist
Basically, everything visible on the Figure is an Artist (even Figure, Axes, and Axis objects). This 
includes Text objects, Line2D objects, collections objects, Patch objects, etc. When the Figure is 
rendered, all of the Artists are drawn to the canvas. Most Artists are tied to an Axes; such an 
Artist cannot be shared by multiple Axes, or moved from one to another.

Types of inputs to plotting functions
Plotting functions expect numpy.array or numpy.ma.masked_array as input, or objects that can be 
passed to numpy.asarray. Classes that are similar to arrays ('array-like') such as pandas data 
objects and numpy.matrix may not work as intended. Common convention is to convert these to 
numpy.array objects prior to plotting. For example, to convert a numpy.matrix

b = np.matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b_asarray = np.asarray(b)
Most methods will also parse a string-indexable object like a dict, a structured numpy array, or a 
pandas.DataFrame. Matplotlib allows you to provide the data keyword argument and generate plots 
passing the strings corresponding to the x and y variables.

np.random.seed(19680801)  # seed the random number generator.
data = {'a': np.arange(50),
        'c': np.random.randint(0, 50, 50),
        'd': np.random.randn(50)}
data['b'] = data['a'] + 10 * np.random.randn(50)
data['d'] = np.abs(data['d']) * 100

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 2.7), layout='constrained')
ax.scatter('a', 'b', c='c', s='d', data=data)
ax.set_xlabel('entry a')
ax.set_ylabel('entry b')
quick start
Coding styles
The explicit and the implicit interfaces
As noted above, there are essentially two ways to use Matplotlib:

Explicitly create Figures and Axes, and call methods on them (the "object-oriented (OO) style").

Rely on pyplot to implicitly create and manage the Figures and Axes, and use pyplot functions for 
plotting.

See Matplotlib Application Interfaces (APIs) for an explanation of the tradeoffs between the 
implicit and explicit interfaces.

So one can use the OO-style

x = np.linspace(0, 2, 100)  # Sample data.

# Note that even in the OO-style, we use `.pyplot.figure` to create the Figure.
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 2.7), layout='constrained')
ax.plot(x, x, label='linear')  # Plot some data on the Axes.
ax.plot(x, x**2, label='quadratic')  # Plot more data on the Axes...
ax.plot(x, x**3, label='cubic')  # ... and some more.
ax.set_xlabel('x label')  # Add an x-label to the Axes.
ax.set_ylabel('y label')  # Add a y-label to the Axes.
ax.set_title("Simple Plot")  # Add a title to the Axes.
ax.legend()  # Add a legend.
Simple Plot
or the pyplot-style:

x = np.linspace(0, 2, 100)  # Sample data.

plt.figure(figsize=(5, 2.7), layout='constrained')
plt.plot(x, x, label='linear')  # Plot some data on the (implicit) Axes.
plt.plot(x, x**2, label='quadratic')  # etc.
plt.plot(x, x**3, label='cubic')
plt.xlabel('x label')
plt.ylabel('y label')
plt.title("Simple Plot")
plt.legend()
Simple Plot
(In addition, there is a third approach, for the case when embedding Matplotlib in a GUI 
application, which completely drops pyplot, even for figure creation. See the corresponding section 
in the gallery for more info: Embedding Matplotlib in graphical user interfaces.)

Matplotlib's documentation and examples use both the OO and the pyplot styles. In general, we 
suggest using the OO style, particularly for complicated plots, and functions and scripts that are 
intended to be reused as part of a larger project. However, the pyplot style can be very convenient 
for quick interactive work.

Note

You may find older examples that use the pylab interface, via from pylab import *. This approach is 
strongly deprecated.

Making a helper functions
If you need to make the same plots over and over again with different data sets, or want to easily 
wrap Matplotlib methods, use the recommended signature function below.

def my_plotter(ax, data1, data2, param_dict):
    """
    A helper function to make a graph.
    """
    out = ax.plot(data1, data2, **param_dict)
    return out
which you would then use twice to populate two subplots:

data1, data2, data3, data4 = np.random.randn(4, 100)  # make 4 random data sets
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(5, 2.7))
my_plotter(ax1, data1, data2, {'marker': 'x'})
my_plotter(ax2, data3, data4, {'marker': 'o'})
quick start
Note that if you want to install these as a python package, or any other customizations you could 
use one of the many templates on the web; Matplotlib has one at mpl-cookiecutter

Styling Artists
Most plotting methods have styling options for the Artists, accessible either when a plotting method 
is called, or from a "setter" on the Artist. In the plot below we manually set the color, linewidth, 
and linestyle of the Artists created by plot, and we set the linestyle of the second line after the 
fact with set_linestyle.

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 2.7))
x = np.arange(len(data1))
ax.plot(x, np.cumsum(data1), color='blue', linewidth=3, linestyle='--')
l, = ax.plot(x, np.cumsum(data2), color='orange', linewidth=2)
l.set_linestyle(':')
quick start
Colors
Matplotlib has a very flexible array of colors that are accepted for most Artists; see allowable 
color definitions for a list of specifications. Some Artists will take multiple colors. i.e. for a 
scatter plot, the edge of the markers can be different colors from the interior:

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 2.7))
ax.scatter(data1, data2, s=50, facecolor='C0', edgecolor='k')
quick start
Linewidths, linestyles, and markersizes
Line widths are typically in typographic points (1 pt = 1/72 inch) and available for Artists that 
have stroked lines. Similarly, stroked lines can have a linestyle. See the linestyles example.

Marker size depends on the method being used. plot specifies markersize in points, and is generally 
the "diameter" or width of the marker. scatter specifies markersize as approximately proportional to 
the visual area of the marker. There is an array of markerstyles available as string codes (see 
markers), or users can define their own MarkerStyle (see Marker reference):

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 2.7))
ax.plot(data1, 'o', label='data1')
ax.plot(data2, 'd', label='data2')
ax.plot(data3, 'v', label='data3')
ax.plot(data4, 's', label='data4')
ax.legend()
quick start
Labelling plots
Axes labels and text
set_xlabel, set_ylabel, and set_title are used to add text in the indicated locations (see Text in 
Matplotlib for more discussion). Text can also be directly added to plots using text:

mu, sigma = 115, 15
x = mu + sigma * np.random.randn(10000)
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 2.7), layout='constrained')
# the histogram of the data
n, bins, patches = ax.hist(x, 50, density=True, facecolor='C0', alpha=0.75)

ax.set_xlabel('Length [cm]')
ax.set_ylabel('Probability')
ax.set_title('Aardvark lengths\n (not really)')
ax.text(75, .025, r'$\mu=115,\ \sigma=15$')
ax.axis([55, 175, 0, 0.03])
ax.grid(True)
Aardvark lengths  (not really)
All of the text functions return a matplotlib.text.Text instance. Just as with lines above, you can 
customize the properties by passing keyword arguments into the text functions:

t = ax.set_xlabel('my data', fontsize=14, color='red')
These properties are covered in more detail in Text properties and layout.

Using mathematical expressions in text
Matplotlib accepts TeX equation expressions in any text expression. For example to write the 
expression 
 in the title, you can write a TeX expression surrounded by dollar signs:

ax.set_title(r'$\sigma_i=15$')
where the r preceding the title string signifies that the string is a raw string and not to treat 
backslashes as python escapes. Matplotlib has a built-in TeX expression parser and layout engine, 
and ships its own math fonts – for details see Writing mathematical expressions. You can also use 
LaTeX directly to format your text and incorporate the output directly into your display figures or 
saved postscript – see Text rendering with LaTeX.

Annotations
We can also annotate points on a plot, often by connecting an arrow pointing to xy, to a piece of 
text at xytext:

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 2.7))

t = np.arange(0.0, 5.0, 0.01)
s = np.cos(2 * np.pi * t)
line, = ax.plot(t, s, lw=2)

ax.annotate('local max', xy=(2, 1), xytext=(3, 1.5),
            arrowprops=dict(facecolor='black', shrink=0.05))

ax.set_ylim(-2, 2)
quick start
In this basic example, both xy and xytext are in data coordinates. There are a variety of other 
coordinate systems one can choose -- see Basic annotation and Advanced annotation for details. More 
examples also can be found in Annotate plots.

Legends
Often we want to identify lines or markers with a Axes.legend:

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 2.7))
ax.plot(np.arange(len(data1)), data1, label='data1')
ax.plot(np.arange(len(data2)), data2, label='data2')
ax.plot(np.arange(len(data3)), data3, 'd', label='data3')
ax.legend()
quick start
Legends in Matplotlib are quite flexible in layout, placement, and what Artists they can represent. 
They are discussed in detail in Legend guide.

Axis scales and ticks
---------------------

Each Axes has two (or three) Axis objects representing the x- and y-axis. These control the scale of 
the Axis, the tick locators and the tick formatters. Additional Axes can be attached to display 
further Axis objects.

Scales
In addition to the linear scale, Matplotlib supplies non-linear scales, such as a log-scale. Since 
log-scales are used so much there are also direct methods like loglog, semilogx, and semilogy. There 
are a number of scales (see Scales overview for other examples). Here we set the scale manually:

fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(5, 2.7), layout='constrained')
xdata = np.arange(len(data1))  # make an ordinal for this
data = 10**data1
axs[0].plot(xdata, data)

axs[1].set_yscale('log')
axs[1].plot(xdata, data)
quick start
The scale sets the mapping from data values to spacing along the Axis. This happens in both 
directions, and gets combined into a transform, which is the way that Matplotlib maps from data 
coordinates to Axes, Figure, or screen coordinates. See Transformations Tutorial.

Tick locators and formatters
Each Axis has a tick locator and formatter that choose where along the Axis objects to put tick 
marks. A simple interface to this is set_xticks:

fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 1, layout='constrained')
axs[0].plot(xdata, data1)
axs[0].set_title('Automatic ticks')

axs[1].plot(xdata, data1)
axs[1].set_xticks(np.arange(0, 100, 30), ['zero', '30', 'sixty', '90'])
axs[1].set_yticks([-1.5, 0, 1.5])  # note that we don't need to specify labels
axs[1].set_title('Manual ticks')
Automatic ticks, Manual ticks
Different scales can have different locators and formatters; for instance the log-scale above uses 
LogLocator and LogFormatter. See Tick locators and Tick formatters for other formatters and locators 
and information for writing your own.

Plotting dates and strings
Matplotlib can handle plotting arrays of dates and arrays of strings, as well as floating point 
numbers. These get special locators and formatters as appropriate. For dates:

from matplotlib.dates import ConciseDateFormatter

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 2.7), layout='constrained')
dates = np.arange(np.datetime64('2021-11-15'), np.datetime64('2021-12-25'),
                  np.timedelta64(1, 'h'))
data = np.cumsum(np.random.randn(len(dates)))
ax.plot(dates, data)
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(ConciseDateFormatter(ax.xaxis.get_major_locator()))
quick start
For more information see the date examples (e.g. Date tick labels)

For strings, we get categorical plotting (see: Plotting categorical variables).

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 2.7), layout='constrained')
categories = ['turnips', 'rutabaga', 'cucumber', 'pumpkins']

ax.bar(categories, np.random.rand(len(categories)))
quick start
One caveat about categorical plotting is that some methods of parsing text files return a list of 
strings, even if the strings all represent numbers or dates. If you pass 1000 strings, Matplotlib 
will think you meant 1000 categories and will add 1000 ticks to your plot!

Additional Axis objects
Plotting data of different magnitude in one chart may require an additional y-axis. Such an Axis can 
be created by using twinx to add a new Axes with an invisible x-axis and a y-axis positioned at the 
right (analogously for twiny). See Plots with different scales for another example.

Similarly, you can add a secondary_xaxis or secondary_yaxis having a different scale than the main 
Axis to represent the data in different scales or units. See Secondary Axis for further examples.

fig, (ax1, ax3) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(7, 2.7), layout='constrained')
l1, = ax1.plot(t, s)
ax2 = ax1.twinx()
l2, = ax2.plot(t, range(len(t)), 'C1')
ax2.legend([l1, l2], ['Sine (left)', 'Straight (right)'])

ax3.plot(t, s)
ax3.set_xlabel('Angle [rad]')
ax4 = ax3.secondary_xaxis('top', (np.rad2deg, np.deg2rad))
ax4.set_xlabel('Angle [°]')
quick start

Color mapped data
-----------------

Often we want to have a third dimension in a plot represented by colors in a colormap. Matplotlib 
has a number of plot types that do this:

from matplotlib.colors import LogNorm

X, Y = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-3, 3, 128), np.linspace(-3, 3, 128))
Z = (1 - X/2 + X**5 + Y**3) * np.exp(-X**2 - Y**2)

fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, layout='constrained')
pc = axs[0, 0].pcolormesh(X, Y, Z, vmin=-1, vmax=1, cmap='RdBu_r')
fig.colorbar(pc, ax=axs[0, 0])
axs[0, 0].set_title('pcolormesh()')

co = axs[0, 1].contourf(X, Y, Z, levels=np.linspace(-1.25, 1.25, 11))
fig.colorbar(co, ax=axs[0, 1])
axs[0, 1].set_title('contourf()')

pc = axs[1, 0].imshow(Z**2 * 100, cmap='plasma', norm=LogNorm(vmin=0.01, vmax=100))
fig.colorbar(pc, ax=axs[1, 0], extend='both')
axs[1, 0].set_title('imshow() with LogNorm()')

pc = axs[1, 1].scatter(data1, data2, c=data3, cmap='RdBu_r')
fig.colorbar(pc, ax=axs[1, 1], extend='both')
axs[1, 1].set_title('scatter()')
pcolormesh(), contourf(), imshow() with LogNorm(), scatter()
Colormaps
These are all examples of Artists that derive from ScalarMappable objects. They all can set a linear 
mapping between vmin and vmax into the colormap specified by cmap. Matplotlib has many colormaps to 
choose from (Choosing Colormaps in Matplotlib) you can make your own (Creating Colormaps in 
Matplotlib) or download as third-party packages.

Normalizations
Sometimes we want a non-linear mapping of the data to the colormap, as in the LogNorm example above. 
We do this by supplying the ScalarMappable with the norm argument instead of vmin and vmax. More 
normalizations are shown at Colormap normalization.

Colorbars
Adding a colorbar gives a key to relate the color back to the underlying data. Colorbars are 
figure-level Artists, and are attached to a ScalarMappable (where they get their information about 
the norm and colormap) and usually steal space from a parent Axes. Placement of colorbars can be 
complex: see Placing colorbars for details. You can also change the appearance of colorbars with the 
extend keyword to add arrows to the ends, and shrink and aspect to control the size. Finally, the 
colorbar will have default locators and formatters appropriate to the norm. These can be changed as 
for other Axis objects.

Working with multiple Figures and Axes
--------------------------------------

You can open multiple Figures with multiple calls to fig = plt.figure() or fig2, ax = 
plt.subplots(). By keeping the object references you can add Artists to either Figure.

Multiple Axes can be added a number of ways, but the most basic is plt.subplots() as used above. One 
can achieve more complex layouts, with Axes objects spanning columns or rows, using subplot_mosaic.

fig, axd = plt.subplot_mosaic([['upleft', 'right'],
                               ['lowleft', 'right']], layout='constrained')
axd['upleft'].set_title('upleft')
axd['lowleft'].set_title('lowleft')
axd['right'].set_title('right')
upleft, right, lowleft
Matplotlib has quite sophisticated tools for arranging Axes: See Arranging multiple Axes in a Figure 
and Complex and semantic figure composition (subplot_mosaic).
