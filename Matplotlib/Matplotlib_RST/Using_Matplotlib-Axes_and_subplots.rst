Axes and subplots
=================

https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/axes/index.html

Matplotlib ``Axes`` are the gateway to creating your data visualizations. Once an Axes is placed on a 
figure there are many methods that can be used to add data to the Axes. An Axes typically has a pair 
of ``Axis`` Artists that define the data coordinate system, and include methods to add annotations like 
x- and y-labels, titles, and legends.

* Introduction to Axes (or Subplots)

   - Creating Axes
   - Axes plotting methods
   - Axes labelling and annotation
   - Axes limits, scales, and ticking
   - Axes layout

* Arranging multiple Axes in a Figure
* Placing colorbars
* Autoscaling axes
* Axis scales

- loglog and semilogx/y
- Other built-in scales
- Optional arguments for scales
- Arbitrary function scales
- What is a "scale"?

* Axis ticks

- Manual location and formats
- Locators and Formatters
- Styling ticks (tick parameters)

* Plotting dates and strings

- Date conversion
- String conversion: categorical plots
- Determine converter, formatter, and locator on an axis
- More about "unit" support

* Legends

- Controlling the legend entries
- Creating artists specifically for adding to the legend (aka. Proxy artists)
- Legend location
- Multiple legends on the same Axes
- Legend handlers

* Subplot mosaic
- String short-hand
- Axes spanning multiple rows/columns
- Controlling mosaic creation
- Controlling subplot creation
- Nested list input

* Constrained layout guide
* Tight layout guide (mildly discouraged)
