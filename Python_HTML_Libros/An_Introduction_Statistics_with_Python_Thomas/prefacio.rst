Preface
=======

In the data analysis for my own research work, I was often slowed down by two
things: (1) I did not know enough statistics, and (2) the books available would
provide a theoretical background, but no real practical help. The book you are
holding in your hands (or on your tablet or laptop) is intended to be the book that
will solve this very problem. It is designed to provide enough basic understanding
so that you know what you are doing, and it should equip you with the tools you
need. I believe that the Python solutions provided in this book for the most basic
statistical problems address at least 90 % of the problems that most physicists,
biologists, and medical doctors encounter in their work. So if you are the typical
graduate student working on a degree, or a medical researcher analyzing the latest
experiments, chances are that you will find the tools you require here—explanation
and source-code included.

This is the reason I have focused on statistical basics and hypothesis tests in this
book and refer only briefly to other statistical approaches. I am well aware that most
of the tests presented in this book can also be carried out using statistical modeling.
But in many cases, this is not the methodology used in many life science journals.
Advanced statistical analysis goes beyond the scope of this book and—to be frank—
exceeds my own knowledge of statistics.

My motivation for providing the solutions in Python is based on two considera-
tions. One is that I would like them to be available to everyone. While commercial
solutions like Matlab, SPSS, Minitab, etc., offer powerful tools, most can only use
them legally in an academic setting. In contrast, Python is completely free (“as in
free beer” is often heard in the Python community). The second reason is that Python
is the most beautiful coding language that I have yet encountered; and around 2010
Python and its documentation matured to the point where one can use it without
being a serious coder. Together, this book, Python, and the tools that the Python
ecosystem offers today provide a beautiful, free package that covers all the statistics
that most researchers will need in their lifetime.
